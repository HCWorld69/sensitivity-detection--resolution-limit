%%%% My MATLAB code 2 for generating a typical SEM EDX spectra of a random element of my choice (in this example, I will choose carbon) using the given parameters:

%%%% This code generates a simulated EDX spectrum for Copper by defining the energy range and number of points in the spectrum. The spectrum is generated by adding Gaussian peaks at specific energies corresponding to the characteristic X-ray lines of Copper. The sensitivity, detection limit, maximum achievable resolution, and minimum limit are then calculated using the same methods as in the previous example.

Please note that this is just an example and may need to be adjusted depending on your specific needs and requirements. You will also need to run this code in MATLAB to see the resulting plot.

% Define element and its properties
element = 'Copper';
atomic_number = 29;
energy_range = [0 10]; % keV

% Generate simulated EDX spectrum
num_points = 1000;
energy = linspace(energy_range(1), energy_range(2), num_points);
spectrum = zeros(1, num_points);
peaks = [8.05 8.9]; % keV
for i = 1:length(peaks)
    peak_center = peaks(i);
    peak_width = 0.2; % keV
    peak_height = randi([10 20]);
    spectrum = spectrum + peak_height * exp(-((energy - peak_center) / peak_width).^2);
end

% Plot simulated EDX spectrum
plot(energy, spectrum);

% Calculate sensitivity as the ratio of change in output to change in input
sensitivity = max(spectrum) / range(energy);

% Calculate detection limit as the smallest change in input that produces a detectable change in output
detection_limit = min(diff(energy));

% Calculate maximum achievable resolution as the smallest difference between two input values that produces a detectable difference in output
max_resolution = min(diff(energy(diff(spectrum) ~= 0)));

% Calculate minimum limit as the smallest value of the input signal that produces a detectable output
min_limit = min(energy(spectrum ~= 0));
